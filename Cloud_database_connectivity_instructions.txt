#Updating django default database to AWS managed Database

-For this We Use AWS RDS (with Preffered PostgreSql)


    -Login to AWS console and head toward for RDS Service
    -Launch an Postgresql Database instance and note down the username,master username and password of the instance ( it will be shown one time only so make sure to note them down very carefully)
    -Wait for the database instance to be in running state ( Takes approximately 10 min)
    -After Launched, click on the instance and it will show the details of your database
    -Following is the Code snippet:-


                          DATABASES = {
                              'default': {
                                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                                  'NAME': 'XXXXXXX',
                                  'USER':'XXXXXX',
                                  'PASSWORD':'XXXXXX',
                                  'HOST':'database-buddydome.cbw5rxvx0i1x.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
                                  'POST':'5432'
                              }
                          }


          >>> Change name to the username to saved earlier
          >>> Change Username to master username
          >>> Change Password to new Password
          >>> Change Host to new host which is shown exactly on aws console database instance page
    -SAVE CHANGES


With This Your Database is successfully connected via network And can be used with multiple applications as a shared data model.


- If you want to interact with your database with your system you can Use "PGadmin" which is basically for postgreSQL database.
